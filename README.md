USB Drive Activity Completion
Contents
The USB drive contains a mix of personal and work-related files, such as family and pet photos, a new hire letter, and an employee shift schedule. These files may include sensitive information like Personally Identifiable Information (PII), company schedules, and internal communications, making them valuable for attackers to exploit.

Attacker Mindset
An attacker could exploit the personal and work-related information to craft targeted phishing attacks or social engineering schemes. They could use Jorgeâ€™s personal files to gather personal details and company-related files to infiltrate the organization by mimicking legitimate communications or accessing internal systems.

Risk Analysis
USB baiting attacks can include malware like keyloggers, ransomware, or backdoors, which may compromise network integrity. If another employee had used this infected USB, the organization could suffer data breaches or operational disruptions. Mitigation strategies include implementing strict policies to prevent unauthorized USB usage, providing employee training on cybersecurity best practices, and deploying endpoint security solutions that can detect and block suspicious devices. A centralized logging system can help monitor unauthorized access attempts, further enhancing security.
